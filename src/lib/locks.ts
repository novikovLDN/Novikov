/**
 * Postgres advisory locks for background jobs and per-user panel sync.
 *
 * Session-level locks need the SAME connection for lock and unlock, so
 * each helper checks out a dedicated client and holds it for the
 * duration of `fn`. `fn` itself may use the pool freely.
 *
 * Why: the app may run in more than one process (Railway restarts,
 * scaling, dev hot reload). Without a lock every process runs the
 * hourly jobs and two concurrent syncs of the same user could both
 * create a panel user.
